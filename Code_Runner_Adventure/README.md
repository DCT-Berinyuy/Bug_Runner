# Bug Runner: Debugging Adventure (Chaos Edition)

## üöÄ The Project

**Bug Runner** is a whimsical, intentionally chaotic endless runner game created for a hackathon. The theme of the hackathon was to "make the weirdest thing you can think of that nobody asked for but everyone will remember," and this game is our answer to that challenge.

The game puts you in the shoes of a "Coder" navigating a perilous digital world, where you must dodge bugs, collect code snippets, and survive the onslaught of chaotic, random events. It's a game that's designed to be as funny and unpredictable as it is challenging.

## üéÆ How to Play

The controls are simple:

*   **Jump:** Press the `Spacebar`, the `Up Arrow` key, or simply `tap` the screen on a mobile device.
*   **Restart:** Press the `R` key to restart the game after you've met an untimely end.

Your goal is to survive as long as possible, racking up a high score while navigating the ever-increasing speed and chaos.

## ‚ú® Features

This isn't your typical endless runner. Here are some of the features that make **Code Runner** a unique experience:

*   **Endless Runner Fun:** The core gameplay is a classic endless runner, easy to pick up but difficult to master.
*   **Debugging Theme:** You're a "Coder," your enemies are "bugs," and the collectibles are "code snippets." The game is filled with programming-related humor and references.
*   **The Chaos Engine:** This is where the game truly shines. At random intervals, "chaos events" will trigger, throwing a wrench in your plans. These events include:
    *   **Fake Windows Updates:** A fake "Windows Update" screen will appear, pausing the game and testing your patience.
    *   **Inverted Controls:** Your jump controls will be temporarily inverted, turning your jumps into crouches.
    *   **Physics Chaos:** The game's gravity will be randomized, sending you flying or crashing down with unpredictable force.
    *   **Bug Storms:** A swarm of bugs will be unleashed, making survival nearly impossible.
    *   **And more!** Discover all the chaotic surprises we've packed into the game.
*   **Power-Ups (and Downs):** Collect rubber ducks for temporary invincibility, but beware‚Äîsome ducks are cursed!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

*   **Engine:** The game is built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript** and the **HTML5 Canvas API**.
*   **Physics:** A simple physics engine handles player movement, gravity, and jumping.
*   **Rendering:** The game is rendered on a 2D canvas, with all graphics drawn programmatically.
*   **Chaos Engine:** A custom-built chaos engine triggers random events to keep the gameplay unpredictable and exciting.

## üèÜ The Hackathon

This project was created for a hackathon with the following categories:

*   **Funniest**
*   **Jankiest**
*   **Most Useless**
*   **Most Useful**

We aimed to create a game that would excel in the "Funniest" and "Jankiest" categories, providing a memorable and entertaining experience for everyone who plays it.
